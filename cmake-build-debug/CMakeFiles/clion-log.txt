CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:6 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findlibmongocxx.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project
  has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "libmongocxx", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "libmongocxx" with
  any of the following names:

    libmongocxxConfig.cmake
    libmongocxx-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "libmongocxx" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "libmongocxx_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "libmongocxx" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it
  has been installed.
